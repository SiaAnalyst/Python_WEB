# Homework #9
Choose the BeautifulSoup library or the Scrapy framework. You have to scrape the website http://quotes.toscrape.com. Your goal is to get two files: qoutes.json, where you will put all the information about quotes from all pages of the site and authors.json, where you will find information about the authors of these quotes. The structure of the json files should be exactly the same as in the previous homework. Execute the previously written scripts to upload the json files to the cloud database for the received files. The previous homework should work correctly with the newly received database.

## Additional assignment
Use the Scrapy framework for scraping. The crawler should be run as a single script main.py.
