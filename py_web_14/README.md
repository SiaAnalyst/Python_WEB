# Homework #14
In this homework assignment, we continue to finalize our REST API application from Homework 13.

## Assignment
- Using Sphinx, create the documentation for your homework assignment. To do this, add `docstrings` to the required functions and class methods in the main modules.
- Cover the modules of the homework repository with unit tests using the `Unittest` framework. Use the example from the notes for the `tests/test_unit_repository_notes.py` module as a basis
- Cover any route of your choice from your homework with functional tests using the pytest framework.

## Additional assignment
- Cover more than 95% of your homework with tests. Use the pytest-cov(https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) package for control.
