# Homework #2
Your Personal Assistant project now most likely exists as a package on your system, installed globally, and uses the version of Python that is installed on your system with packages installed on it. Use any handy pipenv or poetry tool of your choice to create a virtual environment for your application. Fix the Python version of this environment (specify explicitly which Python you want to use) and set up your working environment (IDE) to work with the environment you created. If you used third-party projects, they should now have a specific version too.

Create a Dockerfile in which you install "Personal Assistant" and run it as a separate application in a separate container.
